# Jenkinsfiles

A collection of terrible Jenkinsfiles that should not be used anywhere near a Production service.

Really. If you use these then they might not work. I could be testing something, or started something I have not finished, and there is a risk that Something Terrible could happen to your Jenkins instance.

If you decide to ignore the above and carry on anyway then feel free. But don't say I didn't warn you.
